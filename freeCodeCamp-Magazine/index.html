      Consciously crafted jewelry, like eco-friendly fashion or green footwear, keeps materials and craftsmanship top of mind. Recycled metals, fair trade gold, conflict-free stones, and even repurposed jewelry components are just a few examples of sustainable materials that are used to maintain a low environmental impact. Apart from a commitment to Mother Nature, investment in skilled labor is also a push toward sustainability—people impact the planet, after all.

With a name loosely translating to “She works” in a local Ugandan dialect, it should come as no surprise that Akola puts women at the forefront. The company was conceived to create meaningful jobs for women in Uganda that not only pay a living wage, but also empower them through leadership and financial literacy programs. As for the global-inspired jewelry, everything uses local and earth-friendly materials such as by-product horn, natural raffia, and recycled glass.</p></li>
